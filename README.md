### üöÄ My Projects

1.  **Tetris Game (C++, OOP)**
    *   **Description:** A console-based implementation of the classic Tetris game. The project focuses on a clean object-oriented design with classes for managing the game board, tetromino pieces, and game logic. Implements core features like line clearing, scoring, and increasing difficulty levels.
    *   **Key Features:** Game state management, collision detection, score system.
    *   **Tech Stack:** C++, OOP Principles.
    *   **Code:** [Tetris](https://github.com/marrreric/coursework-sinev)

2.  **Developer Calendar (C++, Qt Widgets)**
    *   **Description:** Developed the **frontend part** for a desktop calendar application using Qt Widgets. A desktop application for developers to manage their tasks and deadlines. Features a custom calendar widget for visual planning and saves data to a local JSON file. This project was a great exercise in building user interfaces with Qt and handling data persistence.
    *   **Key Features:** Custom Qt widget, data serialization, simple GUI.
    *   **Tech Stack:** C++, Qt Framework.
    *   **Code:** [Calendar](https://github.com/marrreric/personal-calendar_project)
  
3.  **Distributed Traffic Control System (C++, Qt, Networking)**
    *   **Description:** A university coursework simulating a smart crossroad with two traffic lights. The system consists of two separate Qt applications that communicate over a local network using TCP/UDP sockets ("point-to-point" protocol).
    *   **Key Features:**
        *   **Controller App:** Sets system state (Off, Flashing Yellow, Auto, Manual) and timing parameters for the light cycles.
        *   **Visualizer App:** Displays the current state of all traffic lights in real-time.
    *   **Tech Stack:** C++, Qt Framework, Networking (Sockets).
    *   **Code:** [Traffic-control-system](https://github.com/marrreric/coursework-oop)
